# Hardware considerations

## Project plan:

Gonna try to use my open source motor controller, the [MP2-DFN](https://github.com/owhite/MP2-DFN), and this circuit for a [brain board](https://github.com/owhite/MESC_brain_board/blob/main/brainboardV1.0/MESC_brain_board.pdf), a teensy 4.0, and an ESP-32, in combination with [MESC firmware](https://github.com/davidmolony/MESC_Firmware).

## This project would never happen without
* [MP2](https://github.com/badgineer/MP2-ESC), an open source motor controller from badgineer. 
* [MESC firmware](https://github.com/davidmolony/MESC_Firmware). 
* [Netzpfuscher's](https://github.com/Netzpfuscher/TTerm) incredible TTerm work

And a shout out to the PCB and PCBA sites: [pcbway.com](https://www.pcbway.com/) and [jlcpcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com/).

## Hardware
### Brain Board 
* Uses a teensy 4.0 and acts as the central controller
* Runs real-time control algorithms (e.g., balancing, walking gaits, velocity planning)
* Sends motor commands (e.g., desired torque, velocity, or position) over CAN bus
* Receives telemetry (velocity, torque, encoder angle) from motor controllers
* Integrates data from the IMU and other sensors
* Optionally logs data or interfaces with a host computer

### Motor Controller (with custom firmware)
* Executes low-level motor control (Field-Oriented Control)
* Supports:
  * Torque mode
  * Velocity mode
  * Position mode
* Reads angular position from the MT6701 encoder via SPI or PWM
* Computes:
  * Electrical angle for FOC
  * Velocity (from encoder delta over time)
  * Torque (via current sensing or estimation)
* Sends back telemetry via CAN (e.g., torque estimate, velocity, encoder angle)

### CAN Bus
* Full-duplex communication between Teensy and motor controllers
* Carries:
  * Commands: set_torque, set_velocity, enable_motor, zero_encoder, etc.
  * Telemetry: encoder position, estimated torque, velocity, fault codes
* Real-time performance with minimal latency
* Can support multiple motor controllers on the same bus

### MT6701 Encoder
* High-resolution magnetic rotary encoder (up to 14-bit)
* Measures rotor position for the BLDC
* Output via SPI, PWM, or ABI 
* Provides absolute angle, ideal for FOC and position tracking
