I'm designing a two-wheeled robot that will balance using LQR control theory.

You are going to help with the modeling process. I will be showing you some input files, as well as python code that calculates the gains.  Before we begin, I'm going to give you some backround.

One part of modeling is calculating the damping coefficient of the motor b_Nm_s_per_rad, the rotational viscous damping coefficient. It models torque loss proportional to angular velocity: 𝜏_loss = 𝑏𝜔

I created a physical rig that involved a flywheel attached to a motor. The flywheel lies flat, and I spun the flywheel to determine b_Nm_s_per_rad. The result was that I first calculated J, where 𝐽 = 1/2 ⋅ M ⋅ R².

The value for J ended up being 0.00309 kg ⋅ m²

Therefore: b_Nm_s_per_rad = b=τ / J​ = 0.001379 N
