Settling around 0.5 s: Matches your closed-loop dominant pole of roughly −12 s⁻¹ (≈ 1/0.08 s time constant).
gain matrix is aggressive K=[27.5, 2.19] is pretty strong).

🧮 Matrix verification:
  ||ΔA||₂ = 1.831e+01
  ||ΔB||₂ = 0.000e+00

⚙️  Detected damping term in A[1,1]: -18.309 s⁻¹
  → Implies effective b ≈ 0.09015 N·m·s/rad
  Motor model b = 0.09015 → Δ = +0.00%
  ✅ Damping term matches motor electrical model.

⚙️  Control system analysis:
  Eigenvalues of A: [+1.7083+0.0000j, -20.0174+0.0000j]
  ⚠️  System is unstable (expected for inverted pendulum).
  Controllability rank: 2/2
  Observability rank:   2/2
